need a secure way to safeguard one key and two different keys one of them for encryption the message extra time is taken to perform the encryption process.very big prime number to generate the required keys 
unsecured channel, threats and vulnerability consumption much more computational resources. network channel . select two big prime number . n is computed as the modulo for both the public and private keys. 

supports a wide range of industry use caes ranging from governance and finance. data encryption with keys. resistance ability of the encryption key. network security and information security. Each and every round of processing contains S-box,shift rows,mix column and add round keys. The order in which theses four steps are executed is different for encryption and decryption. same in structure and contain data-dependent rotations, modular addition and XOR operations.
