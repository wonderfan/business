数据分析和可视化工具，它提供完整的数据来源基础设施来维护数据的详细历史和演化信息。数据跟踪模块记录数据的原产地，数据的计算过程，以及衍生数据和经历的执行过程。

区块链技术依赖哈希函数计算，哈希函数可以在任何长度的数字信息的基础之上产生一个固定长度的字符串代码。Blockchain technology relies on hashing,
which consists of generating a code of a fixed
length for a given piece of digital information,
regardless of its length. Hashing is important
because it permits someone to verify, by
recalculating the hash that a given piece of
digital information is identical to the digital
information that was originally hashed. This
permits document authentication – proof
that a given document is the same one as the
one that was originally hashed. This is an
important feature of many blockchain systems.
A hash cannot be reverse-engineered to
discover the original document. The process
only works in one direction, from the original
document to the hash. 

Hyperledger incubates and promotes a
range of business blockchain technologies,
including distributed ledger frameworks,
smart contract engines, client libraries,
graphical interfaces, utility libraries and
sample applications. One of the distributed
frameworks is called Hyperledger Fabric
(“HLF”), which is an open-source project
within the Hyperledger umbrella project. HLF
is a modular, general-purpose, permissioned
blockchain system, which can also be seen as a
distributed operating system for permissioned
blockchains.
